## Talks, poster presentations, and slide decks

I enjoy sharing my research with different audiences and have given several talks. Below, you’ll find a list of some of them, along with links to slides and/or videos when available. I also occasionally create slide decks on various topics related to my research, which I share here as well. If you are interested in me giving a talk, please feel free to contact me!
