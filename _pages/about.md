Hi! My full name is Francisco Miguel Castro-Mac√≠as, but everybody knows me as Fran Castro. I am interested in the intersection of mathematics and machine learning ü§ó.

I‚Äôm currently doing my PhD in the [Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://decsai.ugr.es/en) at the [University of Granada](https://www.ugr.es/en), Spain. My research focuses on developing new probabilistic methods for weakly supervised learning and inverse imaging problems, with a particular emphasis on the application of these techniques to the medical domain. My supervisors are [Rafael Molina Soriano](https://ccia.ugr.es/~rms/), and [Pablo Morales √Ålvarez](https://www.ugr.es/personal/pablo-morales-alvarez) at the University of Granada, and [Aggelos K. Katsaggelos](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/katsaggelos-aggelos.html) at Northwestern University, USA, where I‚Äôve also been a visiting PhD student.

I hold a [BSc in Mathematics](https://www.ugr.es/en/study/undergraduate/bachelors-degree-mathematics), a [BSc in Computer Science](https://grados.ugr.es/informatica/docencia/plan-estudios), and an [MSc in Data Science and Computer Engineering](https://masteres.ugr.es/datcom/docencia/plan-estudios) -- all from the University of Granada (yes, I‚Äôve been around here for a while!). 

Check out my [publications](/publications/) for the full list of my work, or my [CV](/cv/) for a quick overview of my academic journey. In [Outreach](/outreach/) you can find a list of my outreach activities, including talks and appearances in news and media. In [Teaching](/teaching/) you can find a list of the courses I have taught and BSc / MSc theses I have supervised.

If you want to get in contact with me, send me an email to [francastro8b@gmail.com](mailto:francastro8b@gmail.com). I‚Äôm always happy to chat about research, collaborations, or just to say hi! üòä
